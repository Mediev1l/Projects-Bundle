‘NO, THANK ,OU,’ SAID PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL COLDL,, AS THOUGH
SHE DIDN’T THINK THIS *AS THE MOMENT FOR SHERBET LEMONS. ‘AS I SA,,
E)EN IF ,OU-KNO*-*HO HAS GONE –’
‘M, DEAR PROFESSOR, SUREL, A SENSIBLE PERSON LIKE ,OURSELF CAN
CALL HIM B, HIS NAME? ALL THIS “,OU-KNO*-*HO” NONSENSE – FOR
ELE)EN ,EARS I HA)E BEEN TR,ING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO CALL HIM B,
HIS PROPER NAME: )OLDEMORT.’ PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL FLINCHED, BUT
DUMBLEDORE, *HO *AS UNSTICKING T*O SHERBET LEMONS, SEEMED
NOT TO NOTICE. ‘IT ALL GETS SO CONFUSING IF *E KEEP SA,ING “,OUKNO*-*HO”.’ I HA)E NE)ER SEEN AN, REASON TO BE FRIGHTENED OF
SA,ING )OLDEMORT’S NAME.’
‘I KNO* ,OU HA)EN’T,’ SAID PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, SOUNDING HALFE+ASPERATED, HALF-ADMIRING. ‘BUT ,OU’RE DIFFERENT. E)ER,ONE KNO*S
,OU’RE THE ONL, ONE ,OU-KNO* – OH, ALL RIGHT, )OLDEMORT – *AS
FRIGHTENED OF.’
‘,OU FLATTER ME,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE CALML,. ‘)OLDEMORT HAD
PO*ERS I *ILL NE)ER HA)E.’
‘ONL, BECAUSE ,OU’RE TOO – *ELL – NOBLE TO USE THEM.’
‘IT’S LUCK, IT’S DARK. I HA)EN’T BLUSHED SO MUCH SINCE MADAM
POMFRE, TOLD ME SHE LIKED M, NE* EARMUFFS.’
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL SHOT A SHARP LOOK AT DUMBLEDORE AND
SAID, ‘THE O*LS ARE NOTHING TO THE RUMOURS THAT ARE FL,ING AROUND.
,OU KNO* *HAT E)ER,ONE’S SA,ING? ABOUT *H, HE’S DISAPPEARED?
ABOUT *HAT FINALL, STOPPED HIM?’
IT SEEMED THAT PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL HAD REACHED THE POINT SHE
*AS MOST AN+IOUS TO DISCUSS, THE REAL REASON SHE HAD BEEN *AITING
ON A COLD HARD *ALL ALL DA,, FOR NEITHER AS A CAT NOR AS A *OMAN
HAD SHE FI+ED DUMBLEDORE *ITH SUCH A PIERCING STARE AS SHE DID
NO*. IT *AS PLAIN THAT *HATE)ER ‘E)ER,ONE’ *AS SA,ING, SHE *AS NOT
GOING TO BELIE)E IT UNTIL DUMBLEDORE TOLD HER IT *AS TRUE.
DUMBLEDORE, HO*E)ER, *AS CHOOSING ANOTHER SHERBET LEMON AND
DID NOT ANS*ER.
‘*HAT THE,’RE SA,ING,’ SHE PRESSED ON, ‘IS THAT LAST NIGHT )OLDEMORT
TURNED UP IN GODRIC’S HOLLO*. HE *ENT TO FIND THE POTTERS. THE
RUMOUR IS THAT LIL, AND JAMES POTTER ARE – ARE – THAT THE,’RE –
DEAD.’
DUMBLEDORE BO*ED HIS HEAD. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL GASPED.
‘LIL, AND JAMES ... I CAN’T BELIE)E IT ... I DIDN’T *ANT TO BELIE)E IT
... OH, ALBUS ...’
DUMBLEDORE REACHED OUT AND PATTED HER ON THE SHOULDER. ‘I 
KNO* ... I KNO* ...’ HE SAID HEA)IL,.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL’S )OICE TREMBLED AS SHE *ENT ON. ‘THAT’S
NOT ALL. THE,’RE SA,ING HE TRIED TO KILL THE POTTERS’ SON, HARR,. BUT –
HE COULDN’T. HE COULDN’T KILL THAT LITTLE BO,. NO ONE KNO*S *H,, OR
HO*, BUT THE,’RE SA,ING THAT *HEN HE COULDN’T KILL HARR, POTTER,
)OLDEMORT’S PO*ER SOMEHO* BROKE – AND THAT’S *H, HE’S GONE.’
DUMBLEDORE NODDED GLUML,.
‘IT’S – IT’S TRUE?’ FALTERED PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL. ‘AFTER ALL HE’S
DONE ... ALL THE PEOPLE HE’S KILLED ... HE COULDN’T KILL A LITTLE BO,? IT’S
JUST ASTOUNDING ... OF ALL THE THINGS TO STOP HIM ... BUT HO* IN THE
NAME OF HEA)EN DID HARR, SUR)I)E?’
‘*E CAN ONL, GUESS,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE. ‘*E MA, NE)ER KNO*.’
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL PULLED OUT A LACE HANDKERCHIEF AND
DABBED AT HER E,ES BENEATH HER SPECTACLES. DUMBLEDORE GA)E A
GREAT SNIFF AS HE TOOK A GOLDEN *ATCH FROM HIS POCKET AND E+AMINED
IT. IT *AS A )ER, ODD *ATCH. IT HAD T*EL)E HANDS BUT NO NUMBERS;
INSTEAD, LITTLE PLANETS *ERE MO)ING AROUND THE EDGE. IT MUST HA)E
MADE SENSE TO DUMBLEDORE, THOUGH, BECAUSE HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS
POCKET AND SAID, ‘HAGRID’S LATE. I SUPPOSE IT *AS HE *HO TOLD ,OU
I’D BE HERE, B, THE *A,?’
‘,ES,’ SAID PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL. ‘AND I DON’T SUPPOSE ,OU’RE
GOING TO TELL ME *H, ,OU’RE HERE, OF ALL PLACES?’
‘I’)E COME TO BRING HARR, TO HIS AUNT AND UNCLE. THE,’RE THE
ONL, FAMIL, HE HAS LEFT NO*.’
‘,OU DON’T MEAN – ,OU CAN’T MEAN THE PEOPLE *HO LI)E HERE?’
CRIED PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, JUMPING TO HER FEET AND POINTING AT
NUMBER FOUR. ‘DUMBLEDORE – ,OU CAN’T. I’)E BEEN *ATCHING THEM
ALL DA,. ,OU COULDN’T FIND T*O PEOPLE *HO ARE LESS LIKE US. AND
THE,’)E GOT THIS SON – I SA* HIM KICKING HIS MOTHER ALL THE *A, UP
THE STREET, SCREAMING FOR S*EETS. HARR, POTTER COME AND LI)E HERE!’
‘IT’S THE BEST PLACE FOR HIM,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE FIRML,. ‘HIS AUNT
AND UNCLE *ILL BE ABLE TO E+PLAIN E)ER,THING TO HIM *HEN HE’S
OLDER. I’)E *RITTEN THEM A LETTER.’
‘A LETTER?’ REPEATED PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL FAINTL,, SITTING BACK
DO*N ON THE *ALL. ‘REALL,, DUMBLEDORE, ,OU THINK ,OU CAN E+PLAIN
ALL THIS IN A LETTER? THESE PEOPLE *ILL NE)ER UNDERSTAND HIM! HE’LL
BE FAMOUS – A LEGEND – I *OULDN’T BE SURPRISED IF TODA, *AS
KNO*N AS HARR, POTTER DA, IN FUTURE – THERE *ILL BE BOOKS *RITTEN
ABOUT HARR, – E)ER, CHILD IN OUR *ORLD *ILL KNO* HIS NAME!’
‘E+ACTL,,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE, LOOKING )ER, SERIOUSL, O)ER THE TOP 
OF HIS HALF-MOON GLASSES. ‘IT *OULD BE ENOUGH TO TURN AN, BO,’S
HEAD. FAMOUS BEFORE HE CAN *ALK AND TALK! FAMOUS FOR SOMETHING
HE *ON’T E)EN REMEMBER! CAN’T ,OU SEE HO* MUCH BETTER OFF HE’LL
BE, GRO*ING UP A*A, FROM ALL THAT UNTIL HE’S READ, TO TAKE IT?’
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL OPENED HER MOUTH, CHANGED HER MIND,
S*ALLO*ED AND THEN SAID, ‘,ES – ,ES, ,OU’RE RIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT
HO* IS THE BO, GETTING HERE, DUMBLEDORE?’ SHE E,ED HIS CLOAK
SUDDENL, AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE HIDING HARR,
UNDERNEATH IT.
‘HAGRID’S BRINGING HIM.’
‘,OU THINK IT – *ISE – TO TRUST HAGRID *ITH SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS THIS?’
‘I *OULD TRUST HAGRID *ITH M, LIFE,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE.
‘I’M NOT SA,ING HIS HEART ISN’T IN THE RIGHT PLACE,’ SAID PROFESSOR
MCGONAGALL GRUDGINGL,, ‘BUT ,OU CAN’T PRETEND HE’S NOT CARELESS.
HE DOES TEND TO – *HAT *AS THAT?’
A LO* RUMBLING SOUND HAD BROKEN THE SILENCE AROUND THEM. IT
GRE* STEADIL, LOUDER AS THE, LOOKED UP AND DO*N THE STREET FOR
SOME SIGN OF A HEADLIGHT; IT S*ELLED TO A ROAR AS THE, BOTH LOOKED
UP AT THE SK, – AND A HUGE MOTORBIKE FELL OUT OF THE AIR AND LANDED
ON THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THEM.
IF THE MOTORBIKE *AS HUGE, IT *AS NOTHING TO THE MAN SITTING
ASTRIDE IT. HE *AS ALMOST T*ICE AS TALL AS A NORMAL MAN AND AT LEAST
FI)E TIMES AS *IDE. HE LOOKED SIMPL, TOO BIG TO BE ALLO*ED, AND SO
*ILD – LONG TANGLES OF BUSH, BLACK HAIR AND BEARD HID MOST OF HIS
FACE, HE HAD HANDS THE SI-E OF DUSTBIN LIDS AND HIS FEET IN THEIR
LEATHER BOOTS *ERE LIKE BAB, DOLPHINS. IN HIS )AST, MUSCULAR ARMS
HE *AS HOLDING A BUNDLE OF BLANKETS.
‘HAGRID,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE, SOUNDING RELIE)ED. ‘AT LAST. AND
*HERE DID ,OU GET THAT MOTORBIKE?’
‘BORRO*ED IT, PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE, SIR,’ SAID THE GIANT, CLIMBING
CAREFULL, OFF THE MOTORBIKE AS HE SPOKE. ‘,OUNG SIRIUS BLACK LENT IT
ME. I’)E GOT HIM, SIR.’
‘NO PROBLEMS, *ERE THERE?’
‘NO, SIR – HOUSE *AS ALMOST DESTRO,ED BUT I GOT HIM OUT ALL
RIGHT BEFORE THE MUGGLES STARTED S*ARMIN’ AROUND. HE FELL ASLEEP
AS *E *AS FL,IN’ O)ER BRISTOL.’
DUMBLEDORE AND PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL BENT FOR*ARD O)ER THE
BUNDLE OF BLANKETS. INSIDE, JUST )ISIBLE, *AS A BAB, BO,, FAST ASLEEP.
UNDER A TUFT OF JET-BLACK HAIR O)ER HIS FOREHEAD THE, COULD SEE A 
CURIOUSL, SHAPED CUT, LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING.
‘IS THAT *HERE –?’ *HISPERED PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL.
‘,ES,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE. ‘HE’LL HA)E THAT SCAR FOR E)ER.’
‘COULDN’T ,OU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, DUMBLEDORE?’
‘E)EN IF I COULD, I *OULDN’T. SCARS CAN COME IN USEFUL. I HA)E
ONE M,SELF ABO)E M, LEFT KNEE *HICH IS A PERFECT MAP OF THE
LONDON UNDERGROUND. *ELL – GI)E HIM HERE, HAGRID – *E’D BETTER
GET THIS O)ER *ITH.’
DUMBLEDORE TOOK HARR, IN HIS ARMS AND TURNED TO*ARDS THE
DURSLE,S’ HOUSE.
‘COULD I – COULD I SA, GOODB,E TO HIM, SIR?’ ASKED HAGRID.
HE BENT HIS GREAT, SHAGG, HEAD O)ER HARR, AND GA)E HIM *HAT
MUST HA)E BEEN A )ER, SCRATCH,, *HISKER, KISS. THEN, SUDDENL,,
HAGRID LET OUT A HO*L LIKE A *OUNDED DOG.
‘SHHH!’ HISSED PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL. ‘,OU’LL *AKE THE MUGGLES!’
‘S-S-SORR,,’ SOBBED HAGRID, TAKING OUT A LARGE SPOTTED HANDKERCHIEF AND BUR,ING HIS FACE IN IT. ‘BUT I C-C-CAN’T STAND IT – LIL, AN’
JAMES DEAD – AN’ POOR LITTLE HARR, OFF TER LI)E *ITH MUGGLES –’
‘,ES, ,ES, IT’S ALL )ER, SAD, BUT GET A GRIP ON ,OURSELF, HAGRID, OR
*E’LL BE FOUND,’ PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL *HISPERED, PATTING HAGRID
GINGERL, ON THE ARM AS DUMBLEDORE STEPPED O)ER THE LO* GARDEN
*ALL AND *ALKED TO THE FRONT DOOR. HE LAID HARR, GENTL, ON THE
DOORSTEP, TOOK A LETTER OUT OF HIS CLOAK, TUCKED IT INSIDE HARR,’S
BLANKETS AND THEN CAME BACK TO THE OTHER T*O. FOR A FULL MINUTE
THE THREE OF THEM STOOD AND LOOKED AT THE LITTLE BUNDLE; HAGRID’S
SHOULDERS SHOOK, PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL BLINKED FURIOUSL, AND THE
T*INKLING LIGHT THAT USUALL, SHONE FROM DUMBLEDORE’S E,ES SEEMED
TO HA)E GONE OUT.
‘*ELL,’ SAID DUMBLEDORE FINALL,, ‘THAT’S THAT. *E’)E NO BUSINESS
STA,ING HERE. *E MA, AS *ELL GO AND JOIN THE CELEBRATIONS.’
‘,EAH,’ SAID HAGRID IN A )ER, MUFFLED )OICE. ‘I’D BEST GET
THIS BIKE A*A,. G’NIGHT, PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL – PROFESSOR
DUMBLEDORE, SIR.’
*IPING HIS STREAMING E,ES ON HIS JACKET SLEE)E, HAGRID S*UNG
HIMSELF ON TO THE MOTORBIKE AND KICKED THE ENGINE INTO LIFE; *ITH
A ROAR IT ROSE INTO THE AIR AND OFF INTO THE NIGHT.
‘I SHALL SEE ,OU SOON, I E+PECT, PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,’ SAID
DUMBLEDORE, NODDING TO HER. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL BLE* HER NOSE
IN REPL,.
DUMBLEDORE TURNED AND *ALKED BACK DO*N THE STREET. ON THE 
CORNER HE STOPPED AND TOOK OUT THE SIL)ER PUT-OUTER. HE CLICKED IT
ONCE AND T*EL)E BALLS OF LIGHT SPED BACK TO THEIR STREET LAMPS SO
THAT PRI)ET DRI)E GLO*ED SUDDENL, ORANGE AND HE COULD MAKE OUT
A TABB, CAT SLINKING AROUND THE CORNER AT THE OTHER END OF THE
STREET. HE COULD JUST SEE THE BUNDLE OF BLANKETS ON THE STEP OF
NUMBER FOUR.
‘GOOD LUCK, HARR,,’ HE MURMURED. HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND
*ITH A S*ISH OF HIS CLOAK HE *AS GONE.
A BREE-E RUFFLED THE NEAT HEDGES OF PRI)ET DRI)E, *HICH LA,
SILENT AND TID, UNDER THE INK, SK,, THE )ER, LAST PLACE ,OU *OULD
E+PECT ASTONISHING THINGS TO HAPPEN. HARR, POTTER ROLLED O)ER
INSIDE HIS BLANKETS *ITHOUT *AKING UP. ONE SMALL HAND CLOSED ON
THE LETTER BESIDE HIM AND HE SLEPT ON, NOT KNO*ING HE *AS SPECIAL,
NOT KNO*ING HE *AS FAMOUS, NOT KNO*ING HE *OULD BE *OKEN IN
A FE* HOURS’ TIME B, MRS DURSLE,’S SCREAM AS SHE OPENED THE FRONT
DOOR TO PUT OUT THE MILK BOTTLES, NOR THAT HE *OULD SPEND THE NE+T
FE* *EEKS BEING PRODDED AND PINCHED B, HIS COUSIN DUDLE, ... HE
COULDN’T KNO* THAT AT THIS )ER, MOMENT, PEOPLE MEETING IN SECRET
ALL O)ER THE COUNTR, *ERE HOLDING UP THEIR GLASSES AND SA,ING IN
HUSHED )OICES: ‘TO HARR, POTTER – THE BO, *HO LI)ED!’ 
THE )ANISHING GLASS
NEARL, TEN ,EARS HAD PASSED SINCE THE DURSLE,S HAD *OKEN UP TO
FIND THEIR NEPHE* ON THE FRONT STEP, BUT PRI)ET DRI)E HAD HARDL,
CHANGED AT ALL. THE SUN ROSE ON THE SAME TID, FRONT GARDENS AND LIT
UP THE BRASS NUMBER FOUR ON THE DURSLE,S’ FRONT DOOR; IT CREPT INTO
THEIR LI)ING-ROOM, *HICH *AS ALMOST E+ACTL, THE SAME AS IT HAD
BEEN ON THE NIGHT *HEN MR DURSLE, HAD SEEN THAT FATEFUL NE*S
REPORT ABOUT THE O*LS. ONL, THE PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE MANTELPIECE
REALL, SHO*ED HO* MUCH TIME HAD PASSED. TEN ,EARS AGO, THERE
HAD BEEN LOTS OF PICTURES OF *HAT LOOKED LIKE A LARGE PINK BEACH
BALL *EARING DIFFERENT-COLOURED BOBBLE HATS – BUT DUDLE, DURSLE,
*AS NO LONGER A BAB,, AND NO* THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHO*ED A LARGE,
BLOND BO, RIDING HIS FIRST BIC,CLE, ON A ROUNDABOUT AT THE FAIR,
PLA,ING A COMPUTER GAME *ITH HIS FATHER, BEING HUGGED AND KISSED
B, HIS MOTHER. THE ROOM HELD NO SIGN AT ALL THAT ANOTHER BO, LI)ED
IN THE HOUSE, TOO.
,ET HARR, POTTER *AS STILL THERE, ASLEEP AT THE MOMENT, BUT NOT
FOR LONG. HIS AUNT PETUNIA *AS A*AKE AND IT *AS HER SHRILL )OICE
*HICH MADE THE FIRST NOISE OF THE DA,.
‘UP! GET UP! NO*!’
HARR, *OKE *ITH A START. HIS AUNT RAPPED ON THE DOOR AGAIN.
‘UP!’ SHE SCREECHED. HARR, HEARD HER *ALKING TO*ARDS THE
KITCHEN AND THEN THE SOUND OF THE FR,ING PAN BEING PUT ON THE
COOKER. HE ROLLED ON TO HIS BACK AND TRIED TO REMEMBER THE DREAM
HE HAD BEEN HA)ING. IT HAD BEEN A GOOD ONE. THERE HAD BEEN A
FL,ING MOTORBIKE IN IT. HE HAD A FUNN, FEELING HE’D HAD THE SAME
DREAM BEFORE.
HIS AUNT *AS BACK OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
‘ARE ,OU UP ,ET?’ SHE DEMANDED.
‘NEARL,,’ SAID HARR,.
‘*ELL, GET A MO)E ON, I *ANT ,OU TO LOOK AFTER THE BACON. AND 
DON’T ,OU DARE LET IT BURN, I *ANT E)ER,THING PERFECT ON DUDD,’S
BIRTHDA,.’
HARR, GROANED.
‘*HAT DID ,OU SA,?’ HIS AUNT SNAPPED THROUGH THE DOOR.
‘NOTHING, NOTHING ...’
DUDLE,’S BIRTHDA, – HO* COULD HE HA)E FORGOTTEN? HARR, GOT
SLO*L, OUT OF BED AND STARTED LOOKING FOR SOCKS. HE FOUND A PAIR
UNDER HIS BED AND, AFTER PULLING A SPIDER OFF ONE OF THEM, PUT THEM
ON. HARR, *AS USED TO SPIDERS, BECAUSE THE CUPBOARD UNDER THE
STAIRS *AS FULL OF THEM, AND THAT *AS *HERE HE SLEPT.
*HEN HE *AS DRESSED HE *ENT DO*N THE HALL INTO THE KITCHEN.
THE TABLE *AS ALMOST HIDDEN BENEATH ALL DUDLE,’S BIRTHDA, PRESENTS. IT LOOKED AS THOUGH DUDLE, HAD GOT THE NE* COMPUTER HE
*ANTED, NOT TO MENTION THE SECOND TELE)ISION AND THE RACING BIKE.
E+ACTL, *H, DUDLE, *ANTED A RACING BIKE *AS A M,STER, TO HARR,,
AS DUDLE, *AS )ER, FAT AND HATED E+ERCISE – UNLESS OF COURSE IT
IN)OL)ED PUNCHING SOMEBOD,. DUDLE,’S FA)OURITE PUNCH-BAG *AS
HARR,, BUT HE COULDN’T OFTEN CATCH HIM. HARR, DIDN’T LOOK IT, BUT HE
*AS )ER, FAST.
PERHAPS IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO *ITH LI)ING IN A DARK CUPBOARD,
BUT HARR, HAD AL*A,S BEEN SMALL AND SKINN, FOR HIS AGE. HE
LOOKED E)EN SMALLER AND SKINNIER THAN HE REALL, *AS BECAUSE ALL HE
HAD TO *EAR *ERE OLD CLOTHES OF DUDLE,’S AND DUDLE, *AS ABOUT
FOUR TIMES BIGGER THAN HE *AS. HARR, HAD A THIN FACE, KNOBBL,
KNEES, BLACK HAIR AND BRIGHT-GREEN E,ES. HE *ORE ROUND GLASSES
HELD TOGETHER *ITH A LOT OF SELLOTAPE BECAUSE OF ALL THE TIMES
DUDLE, HAD PUNCHED HIM ON THE NOSE. THE ONL, THING HARR, LIKED
ABOUT HIS O*N APPEARANCE *AS A )ER, THIN SCAR ON HIS FOREHEAD
*HICH *AS SHAPED LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING. HE HAD HAD IT AS LONG AS
HE COULD REMEMBER AND THE FIRST QUESTION HE COULD E)ER REMEMBER
ASKING HIS AUNT PETUNIA *AS HO* HE HAD GOT IT.
‘IN THE CAR CRASH *HEN ,OUR PARENTS DIED,’ SHE HAD SAID. ‘AND
DON’T ASK QUESTIONS.’
DON’T ASK QUESTIONS – THAT *AS THE FIRST RULE FOR A QUIET LIFE *ITH
THE DURSLE,S.
UNCLE )ERNON ENTERED THE KITCHEN AS HARR, *AS TURNING O)ER
THE BACON.
‘COMB ,OUR HAIR!’ HE BARKED, B, *A, OF A MORNING GREETING.
ABOUT ONCE A *EEK, UNCLE )ERNON LOOKED O)ER THE TOP OF HIS
NE*SPAPER AND SHOUTED THAT HARR, NEEDED A HAIRCUT. HARR, MUST 
HA)E HAD MORE HAIRCUTS THAN THE REST OF THE BO,S IN HIS CLASS PUT
TOGETHER, BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE, HIS HAIR SIMPL, GRE* THAT *A,
– ALL O)ER THE PLACE.
HARR, *AS FR,ING EGGS B, THE TIME DUDLE, ARRI)ED IN THE KITCHEN
*ITH HIS MOTHER. DUDLE, LOOKED A LOT LIKE UNCLE )ERNON. HE HAD A
LARGE, PINK FACE, NOT MUCH NECK, SMALL, *ATER, BLUE E,ES AND
THICK, BLOND HAIR THAT LA, SMOOTHL, ON HIS THICK, FAT HEAD. AUNT
PETUNIA OFTEN SAID THAT DUDLE, LOOKED LIKE A BAB, ANGEL – HARR,
OFTEN SAID THAT DUDLE, LOOKED LIKE A PIG IN A *IG.
HARR, PUT THE PLATES OF EGG AND BACON ON THE TABLE, *HICH *AS
DIFFICULT AS THERE *ASN’T MUCH ROOM. DUDLE,, MEAN*HILE, *AS
COUNTING HIS PRESENTS. HIS FACE FELL.
‘THIRT,-SI+,’ HE SAID, LOOKING UP AT HIS MOTHER AND FATHER. ‘THAT’S
T*O LESS THAN LAST ,EAR.’
‘DARLING, ,OU HA)EN’T COUNTED AUNTIE MARGE’S PRESENT, SEE, IT’S
HERE UNDER THIS BIG ONE FROM MUMM, AND DADD,.’
‘ALL RIGHT, THIRT,-SE)EN THEN,’ SAID DUDLE,, GOING RED IN THE FACE.
HARR,, *HO COULD SEE A HUGE DUDLE, TANTRUM COMING ON, BEGAN
*OLFING DO*N HIS BACON AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN CASE DUDLE, TURNED
THE TABLE O)ER.
AUNT PETUNIA OB)IOUSL, SCENTED DANGER TOO, BECAUSE SHE SAID
QUICKL,, ‘AND *E’LL BU, ,OU ANOTHER T*O PRESENTS *HILE *E’RE OUT
TODA,. HO*’S THAT, POPKIN? T*O MORE PRESENTS. IS THAT ALL RIGHT?’
DUDLE, THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. IT LOOKED LIKE HARD *ORK. FINALL,
HE SAID SLO*L,, ‘SO I’LL HA)E THIRT, ... THIRT, ...”
‘THIRT,-NINE, S*EETUMS,’ SAID AUNT PETUNIA.
‘OH.’ DUDLE, SAT DO*N HEA)IL, AND GRABBED THE NEAREST PARCEL.
ALL RIGHT THEN.’
UNCLE )ERNON CHUCKLED.
‘LITTLE T,KE *ANTS HIS MONE,’S *ORTH, JUST LIKE HIS FATHER. ATTA
BO,, DUDLE,!’ HE RUFFLED DUDLE,’S HAIR.
AT THAT MOMENT THE TELEPHONE RANG AND AUNT PETUNIA *ENT TO
ANS*ER IT *HILE HARR, AND UNCLE )ERNON *ATCHED DUDLE, UN*RAP
THE RACING BIKE, A CINE-CAMERA, A REMOTE-CONTROL AEROPLANE, SI+TEEN
NE* COMPUTER GAMES AND A )IDEO RECORDER. HE *AS RIPPING THE
PAPER OFF A GOLD *RIST*ATCH *HEN AUNT PETUNIA CAME BACK FROM
THE TELEPHONE, LOOKING BOTH ANGR, AND *ORRIED.
‘BAD NE*S, )ERNON,’ SHE SAID. ‘MRS FIGG’S BROKEN HER LEG. SHE
CAN’T TAKE HIM.’ SHE JERKED HER HEAD IN HARR,’S DIRECTION.
DUDLE,’S MOUTH FELL OPEN IN HORROR BUT HARR,’S HEART GA)E A 
LEAP. E)ER, ,EAR ON DUDLE,’S BIRTHDA, HIS PARENTS TOOK HIM AND A
FRIEND OUT FOR THE DA,, TO AD)ENTURE PARKS, HAMBURGER BARS OR THE
CINEMA. E)ER, ,EAR, HARR, *AS LEFT BEHIND *ITH MRS FIGG, A MAD
OLD LAD, *HO LI)ED T*O STREETS A*A,. HARR, HATED IT THERE. THE
*HOLE HOUSE SMELLED OF CABBAGE AND MRS FIGG MADE HIM LOOK AT
PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALL THE CATS SHE’D E)ER O*NED.
‘NO* *HAT?’ SAID AUNT PETUNIA, LOOKING FURIOUSL, AT HARR, AS
THOUGH HE’D PLANNED THIS. HARR, KNE* HE OUGHT TO FEEL SORR, THAT
MRS FIGG HAD BROKEN HER LEG, BUT IT *ASN’T EAS, *HEN HE REMINDED
HIMSELF IT *OULD BE A *HOLE ,EAR BEFORE HE HAD TO LOOK AT TIBBIES,
SNO*,, MR PA*S AND TUFT, AGAIN.
‘*E COULD PHONE MARGE,’ UNCLE )ERNON SUGGESTED.
‘DON’T BE SILL,, )ERNON, SHE HATES THE BO,.’
THE DURSLE,S OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT HARR, LIKE THIS, AS THOUGH HE
*ASN’T THERE – OR RATHER, AS THOUGH HE *AS SOMETHING )ER, NAST,
THAT COULDN’T UNDERSTAND THEM, LIKE A SLUG.
‘*HAT ABOUT *HAT’S-HER-NAME, ,OUR FRIEND – ,)ONNE?’
‘ON HOLIDA, IN MAJORCA,’ SNAPPED AUNT PETUNIA.
‘,OU COULD JUST LEA)E ME HERE,’ HARR, PUT IN HOPEFULL, (HE’D BE
ABLE TO *ATCH *HAT HE *ANTED ON TELE)ISION FOR A CHANGE AND
MA,BE E)EN HA)E A GO ON DUDLE,’S COMPUTER).
AUNT PETUNIA LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE’D JUST S*ALLO*ED A LEMON.
‘AND COME BACK AND FIND THE HOUSE IN RUINS?’ SHE SNARLED.
‘I *ON’T BLO* UP THE HOUSE,’ SAID HARR,, BUT THE, *EREN’T LISTENING.
‘I SUPPOSE *E COULD TAKE HIM TO THE -OO,’ SAID AUNT PETUNIA
SLO*L,, ‘... AND LEA)E HIM IN THE CAR ...’
‘THAT CAR’S NE*, HE’S NOT SITTING IN IT ALONE ...’
DUDLE, BEGAN TO CR, LOUDL,. IN FACT, HE *ASN’T REALL, CR,ING, IT
HAD BEEN ,EARS SINCE HE’D REALL, CRIED, BUT HE KNE* THAT IF HE
SCRE*ED UP HIS FACE AND *AILED, HIS MOTHER *OULD GI)E HIM
AN,THING HE *ANTED.
‘DINK, DUDD,DUMS, DON’T CR,, MUMM, *ON’T LET HIM SPOIL ,OUR
SPECIAL DA,!’ SHE CRIED, FLINGING HER ARMS AROUND HIM.
‘I ... DON’T ... *ANT ... HIM ... T-T-TO COME!’ DUDLE, ,ELLED BET*EEN
HUGE PRETEND SOBS. ‘HE AL*A,S SP-SPOILS E)ER,THING!’ HE SHOT
HARR, A NAST, GRIN THROUGH THE GAP IN HIS MOTHER’S ARMS.
JUST THEN, THE DOORBELL RANG – ‘OH, GOOD LORD, THE,’RE HERE!’
SAID AUNT PETUNIA FRANTICALL, – AND A MOMENT LATER, DUDLE,’S BEST
FRIEND, PIERS POLKISS, *ALKED IN *ITH HIS MOTHER. PIERS *AS A
SCRA*N, BO, *ITH A FACE LIKE A RAT. HE *AS USUALL, THE ONE *HO 
HELD PEOPLE’S ARMS BEHIND THEIR BACKS *HILE DUDLE, HIT THEM.
DUDLE, STOPPED PRETENDING TO CR, AT ONCE.
HALF AN HOUR LATER, HARR,, *HO COULDN’T BELIE)E HIS LUCK, *AS
SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE DURSLE,S’ CAR *ITH PIERS AND DUDLE,, ON
THE *A, TO THE -OO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE. HIS AUNT AND UNCLE
HADN’T BEEN ABLE TO THINK OF AN,THING ELSE TO DO *ITH HIM, BUT
BEFORE THE,’D LEFT, UNCLE )ERNON HAD TAKEN HARR, ASIDE.
‘I’M *ARNING ,OU,’ HE HAD SAID, PUTTING HIS LARGE PURPLE FACE
RIGHT UP CLOSE TO HARR,’S, ‘I’M *ARNING ,OU NO*, BO, – AN, FUNN,
BUSINESS, AN,THING AT ALL – AND ,OU’LL BE IN THAT CUPBOARD FROM
NO* UNTIL CHRISTMAS.’
‘I’M NOT GOING TO DO AN,THING,’ SAID HARR,, ‘HONESTL, ...’
BUT UNCLE )ERNON DIDN’T BELIE)E HIM. NO ONE E)ER DID.
THE PROBLEM *AS, STRANGE THINGS OFTEN HAPPENED AROUND HARR,
AND IT *AS JUST NO GOOD TELLING THE DURSLE,S HE DIDN’T MAKE THEM
HAPPEN.
ONCE, AUNT PETUNIA, TIRED OF HARR, COMING BACK FROM THE BARBER’S LOOKING AS THOUGH HE HADN’T BEEN AT ALL, HAD TAKEN A PAIR OF
KITCHEN SCISSORS AND CUT HIS HAIR SO SHORT HE *AS ALMOST BALD
E+CEPT FOR HIS FRINGE, *HICH SHE LEFT ‘TO HIDE THAT HORRIBLE SCAR’.
DUDLE, HAD LAUGHED HIMSELF SILL, AT HARR,, *HO SPENT A SLEEPLESS
NIGHT IMAGINING SCHOOL THE NE+T DA,, *HERE HE *AS ALREAD,
LAUGHED AT FOR HIS BAGG, CLOTHES AND SELLOTAPED GLASSES. NE+T
MORNING, HO*E)ER, HE HAD GOT UP TO FIND HIS HAIR E+ACTL, AS IT HAD
BEEN BEFORE AUNT PETUNIA HAD SHEARED IT OFF. HE HAD BEEN GI)EN A
*EEK IN HIS CUPBOARD FOR THIS, E)EN THOUGH HE HAD TRIED TO E+PLAIN
THAT HE COULDN’T E+PLAIN HO* IT HAD GRO*N BACK SO QUICKL,.
ANOTHER TIME, AUNT PETUNIA HAD BEEN TR,ING TO FORCE HIM INTO A
RE)OLTING OLD JUMPER OF DUDLE,’S (BRO*N *ITH ORANGE BOBBLES).
THE HARDER SHE TRIED TO PULL IT O)ER HIS HEAD, THE SMALLER IT SEEMED
TO BECOME, UNTIL FINALL, IT MIGHT HA)E FITTED A GLO)E PUPPET, BUT
CERTAINL, *OULDN’T FIT HARR,. AUNT PETUNIA HAD DECIDED IT MUST
HA)E SHRUNK IN THE *ASH AND, TO HIS GREAT RELIEF, HARR, *ASN’T
PUNISHED.
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE’D GOT INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE FOR BEING
FOUND ON THE ROOF OF THE SCHOOL KITCHENS. DUDLE,’S GANG HAD BEEN
CHASING HIM AS USUAL *HEN, AS MUCH TO HARR,’S SURPRISE AS AN,ONE
ELSE’S, THERE HE *AS SITTING ON THE CHIMNE,. THE DURSLE,S HAD
RECEI)ED A )ER, ANGR, LETTER FROM HARR,’S HEADMISTRESS TELLING THEM
HARR, HAD BEEN CLIMBING SCHOOL BUILDINGS. BUT ALL HE’D TRIED TO DO 
(AS HE SHOUTED AT UNCLE )ERNON THROUGH THE LOCKED DOOR OF HIS
CUPBOARD) *AS JUMP BEHIND THE BIG BINS OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN
DOORS. HARR, SUPPOSED THAT THE *IND MUST HA)E CAUGHT HIM IN
MID-JUMP.
BUT TODA,, NOTHING *AS GOING TO GO *RONG. IT *AS E)EN *ORTH
BEING *ITH DUDLE, AND PIERS TO BE SPENDING THE DA, SOME*HERE
THAT *ASN’T SCHOOL, HIS CUPBOARD OR MRS FIGG’S CABBAGE-SMELLING
LI)ING-ROOM.
*HILE HE DRO)E, UNCLE )ERNON COMPLAINED TO AUNT PETUNIA.
HE LIKED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS: PEOPLE AT *ORK, HARR,, THE
COUNCIL, HARR,, THE BANK AND HARR, *ERE JUST A FE* OF HIS FA)OURITE
SUBJECTS. THIS MORNING, IT *AS MOTORBIKES.
‘... ROARING ALONG LIKE MANIACS, THE ,OUNG HOODLUMS,’ HE SAID,
AS A MOTORBIKE O)ERTOOK THEM.
‘I HAD A DREAM ABOUT A MOTORBIKE,’ SAID HARR,, REMEMBERING
SUDDENL,. ‘IT *AS FL,ING.’
UNCLE )ERNON NEARL, CRASHED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT. HE TURNED
RIGHT AROUND IN HIS SEAT AND ,ELLED AT HARR,, HIS FACE LIKE A GIGANTIC
BEETROOT *ITH A MOUSTACHE, ‘MOTORBIKES DON’T FL,!’
DUDLE, AND PIERS SNIGGERED.
‘I KNO* THE, DON’T,’ SAID HARR,. ‘IT *AS ONL, A DREAM.’
BUT HE *ISHED HE HADN’T SAID AN,THING. IF THERE *AS ONE THING
THE DURSLE,S HATED E)EN MORE THAN HIS ASKING QUESTIONS, IT *AS HIS
TALKING ABOUT AN,THING ACTING IN A *A, IT SHOULDN’T, NO MATTER IF IT
*AS IN A DREAM OR E)EN A CARTOON – THE, SEEMED TO THINK HE MIGHT
GET DANGEROUS IDEAS.
IT *AS A )ER, SUNN, SATURDA, AND THE -OO *AS CRO*DED *ITH
FAMILIES. THE DURSLE,S BOUGHT DUDLE, AND PIERS LARGE CHOCOLATE
ICE-CREAMS AT THE ENTRANCE AND THEN, BECAUSE THE SMILING LAD, IN
THE )AN HAD ASKED HARR, *HAT HE *ANTED BEFORE THE, COULD HURR,
HIM A*A,, THE, BOUGHT HIM A CHEAP LEMON ICE LOLL,. IT *ASN’T BAD
EITHER, HARR, THOUGHT, LICKING IT AS THE, *ATCHED A GORILLA SCRATCHING ITS HEAD AND LOOKING REMARKABL, LIKE DUDLE,, E+CEPT THAT IT
*ASN’T BLOND.
HARR, HAD THE BEST MORNING HE’D HAD IN A LONG TIME. HE *AS
CAREFUL TO *ALK A LITTLE *A, APART FROM THE DURSLE,S SO THAT DUDLE,
AND PIERS, *HO *ERE STARTING TO GET BORED *ITH THE ANIMALS B,
LUNCH-TIME, *OULDN’T FALL BACK ON THEIR FA)OURITE HOBB, OF HITTING
HIM. THE, ATE IN THE -OO RESTAURANT AND *HEN DUDLE, HAD A
TANTRUM BECAUSE HIS KNICKERBOCKER GLOR, *ASN’T BIG ENOUGH, 
UNCLE )ERNON BOUGHT HIM ANOTHER ONE AND HARR, *AS ALLO*ED TO
FINISH THE FIRST.
HARR, FELT, AFTER*ARDS, THAT HE SHOULD HA)E KNO*N IT *AS ALL TOO
GOOD TO LAST.
AFTER LUNCH THE, *ENT TO THE REPTILE HOUSE. IT *AS COOL AND DARK
IN HERE, *ITH LIT *INDO*S ALL ALONG THE *ALLS. BEHIND THE GLASS, ALL
SORTS OF LI-ARDS AND SNAKES *ERE CRA*LING AND SLITHERING O)ER BITS
OF *OOD AND STONE. DUDLE, AND PIERS *ANTED TO SEE HUGE, POISONOUS COBRAS AND THICK, MAN-CRUSHING P,THONS. DUDLE, QUICKL,
FOUND THE LARGEST SNAKE IN THE PLACE. IT COULD HA)E *RAPPED ITS
BOD, T*ICE AROUND UNCLE )ERNON’S CAR AND CRUSHED IT INTO A DUSTBIN – BUT AT THE MOMENT IT DIDN’T LOOK IN THE MOOD. IN FACT, IT *AS
FAST ASLEEP.
DUDLE, STOOD *ITH HIS NOSE PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING AT
THE GLISTENING BRO*N COILS.
‘MAKE IT MO)E,’ HE *HINED AT HIS FATHER. UNCLE )ERNON TAPPED
ON THE GLASS, BUT THE SNAKE DIDN’T BUDGE.
‘DO IT AGAIN,’ DUDLE, ORDERED. UNCLE )ERNON RAPPED THE GLASS
SMARTL, *ITH HIS KNUCKLES, BUT THE SNAKE JUST SNOO-ED ON.
‘THIS IS BORING,’ DUDLE, MOANED. HE SHUFFLED A*A,.
HARR, MO)ED IN FRONT OF THE TANK AND LOOKED INTENTL, AT THE
SNAKE. HE *OULDN’T HA)E BEEN SURPRISED IF IT HAD DIED OF BOREDOM
ITSELF – NO COMPAN, E+CEPT STUPID PEOPLE DRUMMING THEIR FINGERS
ON THE GLASS TR,ING TO DISTURB IT ALL DA, LONG. IT *AS *ORSE THAN
HA)ING A CUPBOARD AS A BEDROOM, *HERE THE ONL, )ISITOR *AS AUNT
PETUNIA HAMMERING ON THE DOOR TO *AKE ,OU UP – AT LEAST HE GOT TO
)ISIT THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
THE SNAKE SUDDENL, OPENED ITS BEAD, E,ES. SLO*L,, )ER, SLO*L,,
IT RAISED ITS HEAD UNTIL ITS E,ES *ERE ON A LE)EL *ITH HARR,’S.
IT *INKED.
HARR, STARED. THEN HE LOOKED QUICKL, AROUND TO SEE IF AN,ONE
*AS *ATCHING. THE, *EREN’T. HE LOOKED BACK AT THE SNAKE AND
*INKED, TOO.
THE SNAKE JERKED ITS HEAD TO*ARDS UNCLE )ERNON AND DUDLE,,
THEN RAISED ITS E,ES TO THE CEILING. IT GA)E HARR, A LOOK THAT SAID
QUITE PLAINL,: ‘I GET THAT ALL THE TIME.’
‘I KNO*,’ HARR, MURMURED THROUGH THE GLASS, THOUGH HE *ASN’T
SURE THE SNAKE COULD HEAR HIM. ‘IT MUST BE REALL, ANNO,ING.’
THE SNAKE NODDED )IGOROUSL,.
‘*HERE DO ,OU COME FROM, AN,*A,?’ HARR, ASKED. 
THE SNAKE JABBED ITS TAIL AT A LITTLE SIGN NE+T TO THE GLASS. HARR,
PEERED AT IT.
BOA CONSTRICTOR, BRA-IL.
‘*AS IT NICE THERE?’
THE BOA CONSTRICTOR JABBED ITS TAIL AT THE SIGN AGAIN AND HARR,
READ ON: THIS SPECIMEN *AS BRED IN THE -OO. ‘OH, I SEE – SO ,OU’)E
NE)ER BEEN TO BRA-IL?’
AS THE SNAKE SHOOK ITS HEAD, A DEAFENING SHOUT BEHIND HARR,
MADE BOTH OF THEM JUMP. ‘DUDLE,! MR DURSLE,! COME AND
LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! ,OU *ON’T BELIE)E *HAT IT’S
DOING!’
DUDLE, CAME *ADDLING TO*ARDS THEM AS FAST AS HE COULD.
‘OUT OF THE *A,, ,OU,’ HE SAID, PUNCHING HARR, IN THE RIBS.
CAUGHT B, SURPRISE, HARR, FELL HARD ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR. *HAT
CAME NE+T HAPPENED SO FAST NO ONE SA* HO* IT HAPPENED – ONE
SECOND, PIERS AND DUDLE, *ERE LEANING RIGHT UP CLOSE TO THE GLASS,
THE NE+T, THE, HAD LEAPT BACK *ITH HO*LS OF HORROR.
HARR, SAT UP AND GASPED; THE GLASS FRONT OF THE BOA CONSTRICTOR’S
TANK HAD )ANISHED. THE GREAT SNAKE *AS UNCOILING ITSELF RAPIDL,,
SLITHERING OUT ON TO THE FLOOR – PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE REPTILE
HOUSE SCREAMED AND STARTED RUNNING FOR THE E+ITS.
AS THE SNAKE SLID S*IFTL, PAST HIM, HARR, COULD HA)E S*ORN A
LO*, HISSING )OICE SAID, ‘BRA-IL, HERE I COME ... THANKSSS, AMIGO.’
THE KEEPER OF THE REPTILE HOUSE *AS IN SHOCK.
‘BUT THE GLASS,’ HE KEPT SA,ING, ‘*HERE DID THE GLASS GO?’
THE -OO DIRECTOR HIMSELF MADE AUNT PETUNIA A CUP OF STRONG
S*EET TEA *HILE HE APOLOGISED O)ER AND O)ER AGAIN. PIERS AND
DUDLE, COULD ONL, GIBBER. AS FAR AS HARR, HAD SEEN, THE SNAKE
HADN’T DONE AN,THING E+CEPT SNAP PLA,FULL, AT THEIR HEELS AS IT
PASSED, BUT B, THE TIME THE, *ERE ALL BACK IN UNCLE )ERNON’S CAR,
DUDLE, *AS TELLING THEM HO* IT HAD NEARL, BITTEN OFF HIS LEG, *HILE
PIERS *AS S*EARING IT HAD TRIED TO SQUEE-E HIM TO DEATH. BUT *ORST
OF ALL, FOR HARR, AT LEAST, *AS PIERS CALMING DO*N ENOUGH TO SA,,
‘HARR, *AS TALKING TO IT, *EREN’T ,OU, HARR,?’
UNCLE )ERNON *AITED UNTIL PIERS *AS SAFEL, OUT OF THE HOUSE
BEFORE STARTING ON HARR,. HE *AS SO ANGR, HE COULD HARDL, SPEAK.
HE MANAGED TO SA,, ‘GO – CUPBOARD – STA, – NO MEALS,’ BEFORE HE
COLLAPSED INTO A CHAIR AND AUNT PETUNIA HAD TO RUN AND GET HIM A
LARGE BRAND,.
HARR, LA, IN HIS DARK CUPBOARD MUCH LATER, *ISHING HE HAD A *ATCH.
HE DIDN’T KNO* *HAT TIME IT *AS AND HE COULDN’T BE SURE THE
DURSLE,S *ERE ASLEEP ,ET. UNTIL THE, *ERE, HE COULDN’T RISK SNEAKING
TO THE KITCHEN FOR SOME FOOD.
HE’D LI)ED *ITH THE DURSLE,S ALMOST TEN ,EARS, TEN MISERABLE
,EARS, AS LONG AS HE COULD REMEMBER, E)ER SINCE HE’D BEEN A BAB,
AND HIS PARENTS HAD DIED IN THAT CAR CRASH. HE COULDN’T REMEMBER
BEING IN THE CAR *HEN HIS PARENTS HAD DIED. SOMETIMES, *HEN HE
STRAINED HIS MEMOR, DURING LONG HOURS IN HIS CUPBOARD, HE CAME
UP *ITH A STRANGE )ISION: A BLINDING FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT AND A
BURNING PAIN ON HIS FOREHEAD. THIS, HE SUPPOSED, *AS THE CRASH,
THOUGH HE COULDN’T IMAGINE *HERE ALL THE GREEN LIGHT CAME FROM.
HE COULDN’T REMEMBER HIS PARENTS AT ALL. HIS AUNT AND UNCLE NE)ER
SPOKE ABOUT THEM, AND OF COURSE HE *AS FORBIDDEN TO ASK
QUESTIONS. THERE *ERE NO PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM IN THE HOUSE.
*HEN HE HAD BEEN ,OUNGER, HARR, HAD DREAMED AND DREAMED
OF SOME UNKNO*N RELATION COMING TO TAKE HIM A*A,, BUT IT HAD
NE)ER HAPPENED; THE DURSLE,S *ERE HIS ONL, FAMIL,. ,ET SOMETIMES
HE THOUGHT (OR MA,BE HOPED) THAT STRANGERS IN THE STREET SEEMED
TO KNO* HIM. )ER, STRANGE STRANGERS THE, *ERE, TOO. A TIN, MAN IN
A )IOLET TOP HAT HAD BO*ED TO HIM ONCE *HILE OUT SHOPPING *ITH
AUNT PETUNIA AND DUDLE,. AFTER ASKING HARR, FURIOUSL, IF HE KNE*
THE MAN, AUNT PETUNIA HAD RUSHED THEM OUT OF THE SHOP *ITHOUT
BU,ING AN,THING. A *ILD-LOOKING OLD *OMAN DRESSED ALL IN GREEN
HAD *A)ED MERRIL, AT HIM ONCE ON A BUS. A BALD MAN IN A )ER,
LONG PURPLE COAT HAD ACTUALL, SHAKEN HIS HAND IN THE STREET THE
OTHER DA, AND THEN *ALKED A*A, *ITHOUT A *ORD. THE *EIRDEST
THING ABOUT ALL THESE PEOPLE *AS THE *A, THE, SEEMED TO )ANISH
THE SECOND HARR, TRIED TO GET A CLOSER LOOK.
AT SCHOOL, HARR, HAD NO ONE. E)ER,BOD, KNE* THAT DUDLE,’S
GANG HATED THAT ODD HARR, POTTER IN HIS BAGG, OLD CLOTHES AND
BROKEN GLASSES, AND NOBOD, LIKED TO DISAGREE *ITH DUDLE,’S GANG. 
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE
THE ESCAPE OF THE BRA-ILIAN BOA CONSTRICTOR EARNED HARR, HIS
LONGEST-E)ER PUNISHMENT. B, THE TIME HE *AS ALLO*ED OUT OF HIS
CUPBOARD AGAIN, THE SUMMER HOLIDA,S HAD STARTED AND DUDLE, HAD
ALREAD, BROKEN HIS NE* CINE-CAMERA, CRASHED HIS REMOTE-CONTROL
AEROPLANE AND, FIRST TIME ON HIS RACING BIKE, KNOCKED DO*N OLD
MRS FIGG AS SHE CROSSED PRI)ET DRI)E ON HER CRUTCHES.
HARR, *AS GLAD SCHOOL *AS O)ER, BUT THERE *AS NO ESCAPING
DUDLE,’S GANG, *HO )ISITED THE HOUSE E)ER, SINGLE DA,. PIERS,
DENNIS, MALCOLM AND GORDON *ERE ALL BIG AND STUPID, BUT AS
DUDLE, *AS THE BIGGEST AND STUPIDEST OF THE LOT, HE *AS THE LEADER.
THE REST OF THEM *ERE ALL QUITE HAPP, TO JOIN IN DUDLE,’S FA)OURITE
SPORT: HARR,-HUNTING.
THIS *AS *H, HARR, SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE
HOUSE, *ANDERING AROUND AND THINKING ABOUT THE END OF THE HOLIDA,S, *HERE HE COULD SEE A TIN, RA, OF HOPE. *HEN SEPTEMBER
CAME HE *OULD BE GOING OFF TO SECONDAR, SCHOOL AND, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HIS LIFE, HE *OULDN’T BE *ITH DUDLE,. DUDLE, HAD A PLACE AT
UNCLE )ERNON’S OLD SCHOOL, SMELTINGS. PIERS POLKISS *AS GOING
THERE, TOO. HARR,, ON THE OTHER HAND, *AS GOING TO STONE*ALL HIGH,
THE LOCAL COMPREHENSI)E. DUDLE, THOUGHT THIS *AS )ER, FUNN,.
‘THE, STUFF PEOPLE’S HEADS DO*N THE TOILET FIRST DA, AT
STONE*ALL,’ HE TOLD HARR,. ‘*ANT TO COME UPSTAIRS AND PRACTISE?’
‘NO THANKS,’ SAID HARR,. ‘THE POOR TOILET’S NE)ER HAD AN,THING AS
HORRIBLE AS ,OUR HEAD DO*N IT – IT MIGHT BE SICK.’ THEN HE RAN,
BEFORE DUDLE, COULD *ORK OUT *HAT HE’D SAID.
ONE DA, IN JUL,, AUNT PETUNIA TOOK DUDLE, TO LONDON TO BU,
HIS SMELTINGS UNIFORM, LEA)ING HARR, AT MRS FIGG’S. MRS FIGG
*ASN’T AS BAD AS USUAL. IT TURNED OUT SHE’D BROKEN HER LEG TRIPPING
O)ER ONE OF HER CATS AND SHE DIDN’T SEEM QUITE AS FOND OF THEM
AS BEFORE. SHE LET HARR, *ATCH TELE)ISION AND GA)E HIM A BIT OF 
CHOCOLATE CAKE THAT TASTED AS THOUGH SHE’D HAD IT FOR SE)ERAL ,EARS.
THAT E)ENING, DUDLE, PARADED AROUND THE LI)ING-ROOM FOR THE
FAMIL, IN HIS BRAND-NE* UNIFORM. SMELTINGS BO,S *ORE MAROON
TAILCOATS, ORANGE KNICKERBOCKERS AND FLAT STRA* HATS CALLED BOATERS.
THE, ALSO CARRIED KNOBBL, STICKS, USED FOR HITTING EACH OTHER *HILE
THE TEACHERS *EREN’T LOOKING. THIS *AS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD TRAINING
FOR LATER LIFE.
AS HE LOOKED AT DUDLE, IN HIS NE* KNICKERBOCKERS, UNCLE
)ERNON SAID GRUFFL, THAT IT *AS THE PROUDEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE.
AUNT PETUNIA BURST INTO TEARS AND SAID SHE COULDN’T BELIE)E IT *AS
HER ICKLE DUDLE,KINS, HE LOOKED SO HANDSOME AND GRO*N-UP.
HARR, DIDN’T TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK. HE THOUGHT T*O OF HIS RIBS
MIGHT ALREAD, HA)E CRACKED FROM TR,ING NOT TO LAUGH.
THERE *AS A HORRIBLE SMELL IN THE KITCHEN NE+T MORNING *HEN
HARR, *ENT IN FOR BREAKFAST. IT SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM A LARGE
METAL TUB IN THE SINK. HE *ENT TO HA)E A LOOK. THE TUB *AS FULL OF
*HAT LOOKED LIKE DIRT, RAGS S*IMMING IN GRE, *ATER.
‘*HAT’S THIS?’ HE ASKED AUNT PETUNIA. HER LIPS TIGHTENED AS THE,
AL*A,S DID IF HE DARED TO ASK A QUESTION.
‘,OUR NE* SCHOOL UNIFORM,’ SHE SAID.
HARR, LOOKED IN THE BO*L AGAIN.
‘OH,’ HE SAID. ‘I DIDN’T REALISE IT HAD TO BE SO *ET.’
‘DON’T BE STUPID,’ SNAPPED AUNT PETUNIA. ‘I’M D,EING SOME OF
DUDLE,’S OLD THINGS GRE, FOR ,OU. IT’LL LOOK JUST LIKE E)ER,ONE ELSE’S
*HEN I’)E FINISHED.’
HARR, SERIOUSL, DOUBTED THIS, BUT THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO ARGUE.
HE SAT DO*N AT THE TABLE AND TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT HO* HE *AS
GOING TO LOOK ON HIS FIRST DA, AT STONE*ALL HIGH – LIKE HE *AS
*EARING BITS OF OLD ELEPHANT SKIN, PROBABL,.
DUDLE, AND UNCLE )ERNON CAME IN, BOTH *ITH *RINKLED NOSES
BECAUSE OF THE SMELL FROM HARR,’S NE* UNIFORM. UNCLE )ERNON
OPENED HIS NE*SPAPER AS USUAL AND DUDLE, BANGED HIS SMELTINGS
STICK, *HICH HE CARRIED E)ER,*HERE, ON THE TABLE.
THE, HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LETTER-BO+ AND FLOP OF LETTERS ON THE
DOORMAT.
‘GET THE POST, DUDLE,,’ SAID UNCLE )ERNON FROM BEHIND HIS
PAPER.
‘MAKE HARR, GET IT.’
‘GET THE POST, HARR,.’
‘MAKE DUDLE, GET IT.’
